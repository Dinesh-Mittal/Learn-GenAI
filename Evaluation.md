# Model and App Evaluation

With evolving agentic system, 1 need of the hour is evaluating these agentic application traces continuously to find if any abnormal responses. I think 1 of main (security or malfunctioning) issue with LLM agent based apps will not be that they will stop working or drop dead or malfunction in a certain way; but more that they can turn rogue or malicious or give wrong answers instead of no answers and have no fixed pattern of these issues. I am sure threat actors will use vulnerabilities in models and agentic application systems to exploit and orchestrate those kind of attacks than usual  current kind of attacks.
